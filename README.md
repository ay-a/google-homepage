For The Odin Porject Google Homepage task
Good lord. Setting this up took a while. Basically, you have to create your repository on GitHub, not the terminal. Then you have to clone the repo on your local machine. I've been trying to create a repo locally all this time. It's been kinda nuts, but hey. I managed to get through step 2 of this section.

Nothing important happened at work today. 
I accidentally napped too long so I don't have much time to code. So far, all I did was troubleshoot some issues with VSCode. I was trying to open the Google Homepage HTML in Live Server but it kept showing the freecode camp directory. Turns out, I had to open the entire Google Homepage project directory in VSCode. Anyway, it's a simple problem that took way too long. Hopefully, I can get used to coding with this so I won't be taking too much time on simple tasks moving forward.
